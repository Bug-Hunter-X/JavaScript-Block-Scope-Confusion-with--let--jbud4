The bug is not in the code itself, but in the understanding of JavaScript's block scope. The solution is to understand that variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block of code where they are declared.  The inner `let x = 20` creates a new variable `x` that is only visible inside the `if` block. The outer `let x = 10` is a different variable, and its value is not changed by the inner `let x`. Therefore, the first `console.log(x)` outputs 20 (from the inner block), while the second `console.log(x)` outputs 10 (from the outer block). No code change is needed in the solution file; understanding the concept of block scope is the solution.
